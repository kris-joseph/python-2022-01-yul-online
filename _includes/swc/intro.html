  aims to help researchers get their work done
  in less time and with less pain
  by teaching them basic research computing skills.
  This hands-on workshop will cover basic concepts for
  working with Python, leaving you armed with enough knowledge
  to dive more deeply on your own.
  Participants will be encouraged to help one another
  and to apply what they have learned to their coursework and other projects.
