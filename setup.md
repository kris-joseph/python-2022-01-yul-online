## Installing Python Using Anaconda

[Python][python] is great for general-purpose programming and is a popular language
for scientific computing as well. Installing all of the packages required for this
lessons individually can be a bit difficult, however, so we recommend the all-in-one
installer [Anaconda][anaconda].

Regardless of how you choose to install it, please make sure you install Python
version 3.x (e.g., Python 3.6 version). Also, please set up your Python environment at
least a day in advance of the workshop. If you encounter problems with the
installation procedure, ask your workshop organizers via e-mail for assistance so
you are ready to go as soon as the workshop begins.

### Windows - [Video tutorial][video-windows]

1. Open [anaconda.com/download][anaconda-dl]
   with your web browser.

2. Download the Python 3 installer for Windows.

3. Double-click the executable and install Python 3 using _MOST_ of the
   default settings. The only exception is to check the
   **Make Anaconda the default Python** option.

### macOS - [Video tutorial][video-mac]

1. Open [anaconda.com/download][anaconda-dl]
   with your web browser.

2. Download the Python 3 installer for macOS.

3. Install Python 3 using all of the defaults for installation.

### Linux

Note that the following installation steps require you to work from the shell.
If you run into any difficulties, please request help before the workshop begins.

1.  Open [anaconda.com/download][anaconda-dl] with your web browser.

2.  Download the Python 3 installer for Linux.

3.  Install Python 3 using all of the defaults for installation.

    a.  Open a terminal window.

    b.  Navigate to the folder where you downloaded the installer

    c.  Type

    ~~~
    $ bash Anaconda3-
    ~~~
    {: .bash}

    and press tab.  The name of the file you just downloaded should appear.

    d.  Press enter.

    e.  Follow the text-only prompts.  When the license agreement appears (a colon
        will be present at the bottom of the screen) hold the down arrow until the
        bottom of the text. Type `yes` and press enter to approve the license. Press
        enter again to approve the default location for the files. Type `yes` and
        press enter to prepend Anaconda to your `PATH` (this makes the Anaconda
        distribution the default Python).
